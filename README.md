SonyRemoteFocusBracket is a small program to automate the focus bracketing with sony cameras using Sony Remote program.

Usage:

1. Connect you Sony camera (set to remote control in menu) via USB to your computer
2. Start Sony Remote software and wait until connected to the camera
3. Set objective to AF and in Sony Remote to MF, setup start focus manually
4. Start SonyRemoteFocusBracket, set up amount of images, time intervall (set up high enough to allow exposure and image transfer, otherwise you will loose images) and how coarse the focus shift should be.
5. Start Stacking and wait ... ;)
